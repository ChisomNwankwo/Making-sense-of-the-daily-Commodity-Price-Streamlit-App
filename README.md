The South African Department of Agriculture, Land Reform & Rural Development (DALRRD) aims to achieve equitable access to land, integrated rural development, sustainable agriculture, and food security for all.

One of the crucial components for realizing this vision is the implementation of an effective agricultural marketing information system(AMIS). AMIS plays a vital role in providing valuable data and insights,particularly through its collection of daily commodity prices in thehorticulture, grain, and livestock sectors.

Currently, this information is scattered across various websites andpresented in different formats, making it difficult for buyers and sellers toaccess and analyze the data effectively

Our project aims to automate the collection, scraping, and transformation of this data into a single dashboard that presents relevant statistics and figures in an accessible and user-friendly way.
