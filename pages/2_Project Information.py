The South Africa DALRRD is committed to promoting equitable access to land, sustainable agriculture, and food security for all.

To achieve these goals, DALRRD requires an Agricultural Marketing Information System (AMIS)
that collects and provides daily commodity prices for horticulture, grain, and livestock.

Therefore, our project aims to automate the scraping and transformation of this data 
into a single dashboard, with relevant statistics and figures, to assist buyers and 
sellers in making informed decisions.

This data is essential for buyers and sellers to set and negotiate prices effectively.
